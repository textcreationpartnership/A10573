            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as he hath in heauen his miniſtrynge ſpirites: ſo hathe he in the earthe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted vs his ſpirituall miniſters, and ſtuwardes of his ſpiritual miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to thentent that we ſhoulde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate vnto our brothers for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the celeſtiall philoſophie, euen with lyke charitie as he brought it from heauen vnto vs. Neyther is it vnfea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melye to calle ſyluer moneye, but the money that is ſhut vp in the coffer is not moneye, euen by the teſtimonie of the heathen, which affirme that there cometh no fruite of moneye, if it be not vſed, and this thynge taketh place chifelye in ſpirituall thynges. For they are geuen, for the moſte parte, not ſo muche for oure priuate commo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditye, as for the profite of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacyon.

And therfore hath God geuen vs hys worde, not that we ſhoulde hyde it vnder the grounde, but ſet it abroade for the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyte of others. And therfore muſte we
<pb facs="tcp:16250:55"/>
before all other thynges ſee, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe thys talent, the fayth in Chriſte, and the charitie towarde oure neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures do increaſe, and that we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer oure ſoules from worldely deſy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res, from the tyranny of pryde and en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uye, and to be briefe, that we get ſuche a treaſure, that we be made newe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſtrayngers in thys worlde, and (put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge of the olde Adam) partetakers of heauen, not carnall but ſpirituall. For to dyge in the ground, is to be car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal, and to knowe and teache thynges that be carnal. Nowe yf we beyng car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal, ſhoulde preſume to teach other the thynges that be ſpiritual: we ſhoulde not teach them, but for our ſakes ſhall the worde of god be yuell ſpoken of. And for as muche as in our lyfe we ſerue the deuyll, and Chriſte in oure wordes: we ſhall hynder more with oure lyfe, then we ſhal profyte wyth oure wordes. It is the parte of an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryte, to carye in hys hande, the Te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtament, goodly beſet with golde and gylted, and to diſpute and reaſone

To conclude after that we (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge ryche of ſpiritual gyftes) haue gayned one talent by an other, and do poſſeſſe two talentes, that is to ſaye ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe and doctryne: then muſte we go for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde merilye,<note place="margin">Eph. vi</note> gyrdyng vp our loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and pullyng on oure ſhoes to go forwarde in the Goſpel of peace, that we may alſo wynne the ſoule of oure brothers.

                     <p>There is two maner of peace. The temporall or worldly peace is, when a man hath no diſquietnes of any man and ſtandeth in certaynte of hys lyfe.
<pb facs="tcp:16250:101"/>
The ſpirituall peace, is certeynte of the harte which no man hath, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Chriſten faythfull herte through fayth, for it knoweth &amp; perceyueth, that it hath eſcaped the moſte daunge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous battell, and the greateſt damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, namely the euerlaſtyng wrath of God, and is through Chriſt made ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, agaynſt the feare of ſynne, death &amp; hell, and vnto hym is nowe perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſickenes, and ſufferyng in earth, yea death, and whatſoeuer the worlde counteth, to be horryble and fearfull, a ſmall matter, whiche he regardeth not, ſo ioconde, peaceable, and ſure is hys herte vnto hym. Thys is the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ete herte whiche is a continuall feaſt, as Salomon ſayth.<note place="margin">Pro. xv</note> Thys is that pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, whiche the worlde can not geue, nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther can ſhe take it awaye with al her inimity and rumour, it paſſeth al myn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des and vnderſtandynge as Paule ſayth. The peace of God,<note place="margin">Phil. iiij</note> whiche paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all vnderſtondynge, kepe youre hertes and myndes in Chriſte Ieſu.

                     <p>The worde of God bryngeth thys ſpirituall peace, and deſtroyeth the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy of Behemoth, but the carnal peace it bryngeth not, for it is a word of the croſſe, and not of the wicked voluptu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous lyfe vpon earth.
